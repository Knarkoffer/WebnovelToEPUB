# WebnovelToEPUB
Uses Selenium to allow the user to login and then scrapes the chapters. Uses the excellent library [ebooklib](https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib) to create an EPUB-file of the result.

Created for my own use, with the novel *Release That Witch* as target, but did some generalization to enable it to download other stories as well.

###### TODO:
- Download and add covers to epub
- Section epub in accordance with Webnovels "Volume"
