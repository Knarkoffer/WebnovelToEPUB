# WebnovelToEPUB
Uses Selenium to allow the user to login, and then scrapes the chapters and uses the excellent library ebooklib to create an EPUB-file of the story.

Created for my own use, with the novel Release That Witch as target, but did some generalization to enable it to download other stories as well.

TODO:
Download and add covers to epub
Section epub in accordance with Webnovels "Volume"
